# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this hands-on workshop, you will build a meeting summarization flow using Oracle Cloud services. You’ll upload media to Object Storage, trigger Functions via Events, create AI Speech transcription jobs, summarize with the OCI Generative AI service using on-demand model OCIDs, and deliver results to users via Notifications. Along the way, you’ll apply least-privilege IAM and learn how OCI’s packaged AI services and partner models enable fast, secure outcomes without lock‑in
