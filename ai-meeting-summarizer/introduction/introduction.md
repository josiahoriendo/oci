# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this hands-on workshop, you will build a meeting summarization flow using Oracle Cloud services. You’ll upload media to Object Storage, trigger Functions via Events, create AI Speech transcription jobs, summarize with the OCI Generative AI service using on-demand model OCIDs, and deliver results to users via Notifications. Along the way, you’ll apply least-privilege IAM and learn how OCI’s packaged AI services and partner models enable fast, secure outcomes without lock‑in

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hours 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Build an event-driven pipeline: Object Storage → Events → Functions → AI Speech → Generative AI → Notifications.
* Configure least-privilege IAM and enable AI Speech to write to the results bucket.
* Deploy and test the Transcribe Function (creates Speech jobs) and Summary Function (Generative AI via model OCID).
* Save transcripts/summaries to Object Storage and email results via OCI Notifications.
